# Tkinter_Widget_Class
This repo contains window class with tkinter widgets as methods in order to ease work in tkinter program devlopment

# Why I made this
While making big tkinter programs of approximately 1000 lines , I realised that thing could have got very simplified if I would have used classes in order to create blueprint of every widget (Which earlier I had to make manually for every widget).
